# Image-Slider-with-Pure-JavaScript
This is a Pure JavaScript Project using HTML and CSS. And the project title is Image Slider, I hope you have got an Idea by its name like what it does. Basically this is a fullscreen image slider that changes its each slide automatically after 5 seconds if the user doesn't change the slide manually.
The user can change slide using the previous and next arrow and also can change or directly jump into a slide by using the dots that are at the bottom of this full screen image slider.
